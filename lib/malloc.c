/*
 * malloc.c --- a general purpose kernel memory allocator for Linux.
 * 		一个通用的linux内核内存分配器
 * 
 * Written by Theodore Ts'o (tytso@mit.edu), 11/29/91
 *
 * This routine is written to be as fast as possible, so that it
 * can be called from the interrupt level.
 * 该程序运行的很快，所以可以从中断中调用
 *
 * Limitations: maximum size of memory we can allocate using this routine
 *	is 4k, the size of a page in Linux.
 * 限制: 通过这个程序我们能分配的最大内存是4k，一个Linux页面的大小
 *
 * The general game plan is that each page (called a bucket) will only hold
 * objects of a given size.  When all of the object on a page are released,
 * the page can be returned to the general free pool.  When malloc() is
 * called, it looks for the smallest bucket size which will fulfill its
 * request, and allocate a piece of memory from that bucket pool.
 * 策略是每页(称为桶)只容纳固定大小的对象.
 * 当该页的所有对象释放之后，该页会返回到通用的空闲池中.
 * 当malloc()被调用的时候，它会查找最小能满足请求的桶大小，从空闲的桶池中
 * 申请一部分内存.
 *
 * Each bucket has as its control block a bucket descriptor which keeps 
 * track of how many objects are in use on that page, and the free list
 * for that page.  Like the buckets themselves, bucket descriptors are
 * stored on pages requested from get_free_page().  However, unlike buckets,
 * pages devoted to bucket descriptor pages are never released back to the
 * system.  Fortunately, a system should probably only need 1 or 2 bucket
 * descriptor pages, since a page can hold 256 bucket descriptors (which
 * corresponds to 1 megabyte worth of bucket pages.)  If the kernel is using 
 * that much allocated memory, it's probably doing something wrong.  :-)
 * 每个桶有他们自己的控制块描述符用于跟踪在该页上究竟有多少个对象.
 *
 * Note: malloc() and free() both call get_free_page() and free_page()
 *	in sections of code where interrupts are turned off, to allow
 *	malloc() and free() to be safely called from an interrupt routine.
 *	(We will probably need this functionality when networking code,
 *	particularily things like NFS, is added to Linux.)  However, this
 *	presumes that get_free_page() and free_page() are interrupt-level
 *	safe, which they may not be once paging is added.  If this is the
 *	case, we will need to modify malloc() to keep a few unused pages
 *	"pre-allocated" so that it can safely draw upon those pages if
 * 	it is called from an interrupt routine.
 *
 * 	Another concern is that get_free_page() should not sleep; if it 
 *	does, the code is carefully ordered so as to avoid any race 
 *	conditions.  The catch is that if malloc() is called re-entrantly, 
 *	there is a chance that unecessary pages will be grabbed from the 
 *	system.  Except for the pages for the bucket descriptor page, the 
 *	extra pages will eventually get released back to the system, though,
 *	so it isn't all that bad.
 *
 * 存储桶(page)，存储桶描述符
 * 每个存储桶(page)对应一个存储桶描述符，用于保存关于存储桶的信息
 *
 * TODO: 这个文件中的代码大体逻辑懂了，但是没有仔细分析...
